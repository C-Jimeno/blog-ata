# The Hard Beginning:  Tracking Your Expenses
- ***Track your expenses/spending!***, this might sound simple but it is the most important step when starting your financial literacy journey. You can use an app or manually do it on a spreadsheet, an app  is more preferable as you do not need to configure everything from scratch.
	
- App Recommendations:
	1. Money Tracker (Try this first as it is simpler)
	2. Money Manager - (A bit more complicated)

- The first 3 months you do this, it is suggested that you track everything to the peso. It might be an additional work, however, this first step will be significant in your journey and will help you in the long run. Incorporate it into your daily routine.
